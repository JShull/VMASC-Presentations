# VMASC Presentations

Base repository for misc. presentations that people have given throughout VMASC. This is the first repository setup to allow all people who have access to the VMASC Git repository to post their presentations. Please see the section below for formatting guidelines as we are trying to standardize root folder readmes.

## Format Guidelines

We only ask that you follow a simple format using your name as the root folder for your work. Within your folder please contain a markdown formatted file named 'Readme.md'. See below for the simple requirements. If you need an example, please see [this readme](JohnShull\Readme.md) for an example.
