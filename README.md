# VMASC Presentations

Base repository for some of the public presentations that VMASC people have given. This is the first repository setup to allow all VMASC personnel to freely post their presentations here for others to access. At the moment we just ask that you follow a simple format for readme documentation formatting guidelines.

## Format Guidelines

We only ask that you follow a simple format using your name as the root folder for your work. Within your folder please contain a markdown formatted file named 'Readme.md'. See below for the simple requirements. If you need an example, please see [this readme](JohnShull\Readme.md) for an example.
