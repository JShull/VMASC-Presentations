>Description: A presentation that was given on behalf of the XR Creators group in [AltspaceVR](https://www.altvr.com) This was a culmination presentation of the work done by Hector Garcia, BaTo, Dr. Krzysztof Rechowicz, John Shull, and Saikou Diallo. The project originally was done in a CAVE environment back in 2015-2016 and was later modified by John Shull in 2017-2018. For the presentation given in Altspace in 2020 assets were converted and uploaded to dedicated 'worlds' in Altspace.
