>Description: A presentation that was given on behalf of the XR Creators group in [AltspaceVR](https://www.altvr.com) This was a culmination presentation of the work done by Hector Garcia, BaTo, Dr. Krzysztof Rechowicz, John Shull, and Saikou Diallo. The project originally was done in a CAVE environment back in 2015-2016 and was later modified by John Shull in 2017-2018. For the presentation given in Altspace in 2020 assets were converted and uploaded to dedicated 'worlds' in Altspace.

## SpringSim 2020 Prototyping for Extended Reality

[Game Engines, open source, and toolkits for modeling and simulation spatial software](SpringSim/JShull_SpringSim_20_Tutorial_XR_M_S.pdf)
>Description: This was a presentation given at the 2020 Spring Sim Conference. This year due to COVID-19 the conference was converted to a virtual conference with presentations being given over Zoom. The abstract was put in for a small tutorial presentation in which a 50 minute live stream accompanied the abstract. The tutorial walks users through setting up Unity3D with the latest release of the Microsoft Mixed Reality Toolkit.
